# Digital Minimalism

TODO

* Inspired by Cal Newport's book Digital Minimalism
* Reduce digital "clutter" and recover wasted time
* Most importantly: Have a purpose for the newly won time, otherwise it won't work

### Less computer ðŸ’»

### Less phone ðŸ“±

Most of the time I spent on my smartphone served no real purpose but to let time pass. Facebook, Instagram, News, Twitter, Reddit. Despite attempts to tailor it to primarily show useful things, in the end I used it to mindlessly scroll - at times without even reading or seeing, but just scrolling through the feeds.

#### How to fix it

I can't live without a smartphone \(I need that map! And music! And messaging services!\), but I can dramatically reduced the time I spend on it by doing the following:

* Deleting all the non-utility apps \(so bye-bye social media, news apps, mail, etc.\)
* Make the browser useless \(and avoid the temptation to revert it!\)
  * Set screen time limits to 0
  * Change the language in Safari to something you don't know
  * Disable JavaScript and cookies
  * Start pages in "reading mode" by default
* Turn it into a landline by placing it in a central spot at home with sound on

#### Next steps

* Be better at leaving it at home - if that emergency happens, it really doesn't matter if you know about it now or in an hour!
* Carry a small pocket notebook and write down thoughts there instead of on the phone
