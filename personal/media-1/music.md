### Sources of music I use

* **Vinyl**

Our collection is small but growing. I want to own all the albums I love on vinyl!

* **Spotify**

Often used for daily music while working and at home. I track all the music I have listened to on Spotify at [Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/user/MadsNedergaard).

* **Youtube**

Occasionally used while working when I'm doing deep focus work.

* **Soundcloud**

Rarely used for remixes and DJ sets.
