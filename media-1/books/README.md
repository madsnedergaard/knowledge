### Why read books

...

### Why I'm taking notes while reading

* Help me be better at reflecting on what I'm reading during the reading process
* Keep my thoughts, ideas and citations together after I'm done with a book
* Share it openly to force myself to actually do it!

One rule:

* When I start a new book, I have to create an entry for it!
