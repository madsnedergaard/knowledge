### Tracking things

I love tracking all the things I do and consume \(unless it requires too much manual work\). 

Therefore I'm using a bunch of services to track things and to keep a list of things I want to read/watch/listen to in the future.

#### My lists of things I have consumed and things I want to consume in future:

## Goals

_I general I want to be more conscious about the time I spend on media and entertainment. Therefore I have created the following goals for the future:_

* Consume less junk and more value
  * Less crappy TV shows
  * more books and quality movies
* Save important knowledge here
  * Book notes and summaries
  * Movie reviews
